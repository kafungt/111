# Data

## Description
We decided to use 3 datasets from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&Cycle=2021-2023). The data were collected by National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from Aug 2021 to Aug 2023. The 3 datasets are: Demographic Variables and Sample Weights dataset from Demographics data, Body Measures dataset from Examination Data, and Hepatitis A dataset from Laboratory Data. All 3 datasets were published in Sep 2024 and can be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. We will join the 3 datasets together for our project.
