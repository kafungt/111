    "text": "1 Introduction\nHepatitis A, a viral liver infection, poses a significant public health challenge within the United States. Its effects can be severe in adults, leading to increased mortality. This project aims to analyze the demographic and health characteristics of individuals with exposure to Hepatitis A using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for 2021–2023. By combining demographic (DEMO_L), body measurement (BMX_L), and Hepatitis A antibody status (HEPA_L) datasets, we will answer important questions regarding the factors associated with Hepatitis A exposure.",

The data were collected by National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from Aug 2021 to Aug 2023. The 3 datasets are: Demographic Variables and Sample Weights dataset from Demographics data, Body Measures dataset from Examination Data, and Hepatitis A dataset from Laboratory Data. All 3 datasets were published in Sep 2024 and can be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. We will join the 3 datasets together for our project.\nThe specific information for the 3 datasets are the following:",
