# Introduction
Hepatitis A, a viral liver infection, poses a significant public health challenge within the United States. Its effects can be severe in adults, leading to increased mortality. This project aims to analyze the demographic and health characteristics of individuals with exposure to Hepatitis A using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for 2021â€“2023. By combining demographic (DEMO_L), body measurement (BMX_L), and Hepatitis A antibody status (HEPA_L) datasets, we will answer critical questions regarding the factors associated with Hepatitis A exposure.
